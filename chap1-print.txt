Not that thing Lady Gaga wore to the VMA's that one year--but the one that got famous just because people couldn't decide whether it was black and blue or white and gold? In February 2015, a woman took a picture of a dress she wanted to wear to a wedding, and released the photo on Tumblr after many of her friends disagreed over the color. The picture spread quickly across the Internet, and sparked an intense public debate about the color of the dress. It turns out that this phenomenon can be explained by the pure science of color vision. When scientists pitched in to provide insight into what was going on they found that if the dress was shown in yellow lighting the majority of people would see it as blue and black, while lighting with a blue bias caused people to view the dress as white and gold.* ";

para += "According to color theory, having a color in the background removes that color from the foreground--this is why the dress shown against yellow lighting would make it look less yellow and more blue. I won't get into the specifics of the science behind this because I'm running out of space on this page and frankly I don't fully understand it myself--but this is a very important and interesting concept in color theory that is the basis of many optical illusions. (It also really f**ked me up and made me question whether I was worthy of having perfect color vision.) This chapter is about using this very concept to make 3 colors look like 4. I hope it causes you to lose as much faith in your eyeballs as I did. ";
