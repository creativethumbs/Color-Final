My friend and I made our way to the back corner of the room and sat down, taking out our notes and note-taking instruments and whatever else people possess when they need to study. As more students shuffled into the small office with questions about the material, the afternoon proceeded unremarkably.

But for whatever reason, on that unremarkable Tuesday, during that unremarkable conversation, it was exactly what I did. ";
