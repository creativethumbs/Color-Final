# The Colorist Cookbook

A self-directed final project for my color theory class, The Colorist Cookbook is a Processing program that generates a seven-chapter (+appendix) PDF of color studies. Each chapter of the book contains a body of work that applies a particular aspect of color theory, and each iteration of the book is unique. 

**Motivations**The reason I wanted to pursue this project is because although I felt like I had learned a lot in my color theory class, I was worried that I would end up forgetting the material. By algorithmically creating color studies that applied the concepts taught in class, I was able to more strongly reinforce my understanding of color theory. This project was a valuable learning experience for me, as it allowed me to challenge myself as both a computer scientist and an artist. 
**Closing notes**Due to the random nature of the algorithms in the Cookbook, it is sometimes the case that certain studies are extremely effective--or uneffective. Not all the algorithms work perfectly, and perhaps they never will. It may well be the case that no matter how hard I try to 'perfect' algorithms that illustrate color theory concepts, I will never be able to articulate the complexities of human vision through code. This thought is scary, but also humbling.
