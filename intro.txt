Color, "the property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way the object reflects or emits light"--according to the Dictionary app on my laptop. Here's another: "one, or any mixture, of the constituents into which light can be separated in a spectrum or rainbow, sometimes including (loosely) black and white". Whatever that means.

It is believed that color 'ought' to be separate from language, and that the more we try to define or describe color the further we are from truly experiencing it. When I started writing this book it was never my intention to emerge with a definition of what color is--rather, I was interested in understanding color and seeing whether the things we see with our eyes can be reproduced systematically. Methodically. Algorithmically. But the more I tried to develop these algorithms, the more I realized that describing color was exactly what I was trying to do.

I am at a stage in my life where I am still trying to understand how things in the world work, still trying to figure out who I am, still suffering from the occasional existential crisis. Since I am probably unqualified to articulate something on behalf of other people, this book is not about how color works for everyone. This is about how color works for me.
